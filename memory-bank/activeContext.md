# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and foundation development.

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory bank structure
2. Defined project architecture
3. Established technical requirements
4. Documented core patterns
5. Set up Python virtual environment (.venv)
   - Python version: 3.11.9
   - Virtual environment activated
6. Installed project dependencies
   - scrapegraphai and dependencies
   - playwright browsers installed
7. Configured and tested web scraper
   - Successfully implemented SmartScraperGraph
   - Using google_genai/gemini-2.0-flash model
   - Verified working JSON output for NBN plan data
8. Enhanced execution metrics tracking
   - Implemented execution_info filtering
   - Added TOTAL RESULT metrics extraction
   - Improved error handling in scraper_config.py
   - Verified metrics output functionality

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
   - Initialize Python project
   - Configure virtual environment
   - Set up dependency management

2. Implement core components
   - Basic web scraper module
   - Content processor foundation
   - Gemini API integration scaffold
   - Data handler structure

3. Development priorities
   - Core scraping functionality
   - AI integration framework
   - Error handling system
   - Basic data processing

## Active Decisions
1. Technology choices
   - Python as primary language
   - Beautiful Soup/Selenium for scraping
   - Gemini API for AI processing
   - Poetry for dependency management

2. Architecture decisions
   - Modular component design
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Event-driven processing
   - Robust error handling

## Current Challenges
1. Performance optimization
   - Monitor execution metrics
   - Analyze token usage
   - Track API costs
   - Optimize response times

## Questions to Resolve
1. Specific Gemini API endpoints and capabilities
2. Data storage requirements
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Deployment strategy

## Recent Discussions
- Initial project setup
- Core architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Development priorities

## Current Branch/Version
- Main branch
- Pre-release development
- Version: 0.1.0-dev
